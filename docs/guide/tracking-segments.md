# Tracking Segments

Once you create a Stickle Segment class, Stickle will begin tracking:

-   Which Models are currently contained within that segment;
-   A history of when Models enter and leave the segment;
-   Aggregate statistics about the models in the segment (over time).

This data is available in StickleUI and accessible through API endpoints.
