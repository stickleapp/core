# What is Stickle?

Stickle is a customer analytics and engagement package for Laravel. Use it to:

-   Build real-time customer analytics dashboards;
-   Trigger Laravel notifications based on end-user behavior;
-   Highlight important customer behavior in your admin panel;
-   Segment your customer base to identify high value or at-risk customers in realtime.

Stickle can be further extended by adding 1st-party Stickle apps and can be integrated into other Laravel Packages to expand their functionality.

## Cascade Core

Cascade Core is the foundation of Cascade that:

-   Tracks user attributes and behavior via a Javascript tracking code;
-   Logs authentication events;
-   Logs changes in model attributes;
-   Logs user-defined server-side events;
-   Exposes Eloquent methods for querying your customers;
-   Exposes a REST API endpoint for ingesting events from other channels (Mobile, etc);
-   Provides the ability to define customer segments 'as-code' and track these segments over time.
